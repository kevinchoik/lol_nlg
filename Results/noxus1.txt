oh , we rise . as much as one evil spider lady .
my destination is that all . i 'll show mercy ! high command it 's still watching .
they will not dim !
battle ... but hunger , creature .
the dawn .
no legs but their secrets are a reminder .
without order ?
i move by my hand !
they call me .
men , good partners .
