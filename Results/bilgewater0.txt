you remind me of someone .
everyone 's got a plan .
stack the bodies , would n't even serve a true god ! instead , you fell funny !
bones 'll splinter .
foolish spirit , begone !
everyone 's a chain !
you get mouthy with a crew .
solid ground , feels too stable .
a crew comes in handy sometimes .
breathe the brine !
