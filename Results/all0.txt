what a big sissy !
i thought i was chosen to exact justice .
everything is going to punch ?
what 's the only thing you should n't i , who are you a clich√© or a rug in my league .
this mist has you in .
i smell as bad as i win . your voices die .
can you teach me sometime ? maybe ?
that was ... it 's completely unfair . i know it .
destiny halts for no one saw that . come back later and sift through the gate !
