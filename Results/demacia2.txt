we have feet with thy flesh will feed the worms .
look ! a walking . .
wings of fire , hope fades . your sentence has potential have tossed around here .
bringing the heat , be this gon na pay for it .
i judge we are strong , but the end . .
none may feel the power erupting .
hmhm , kayle .
i am one mired in arrogance , we will rip the just . .
i have no time for restraint .
attacking me for no-one . .
