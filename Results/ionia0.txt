absolute judgement is the person who shows their true face .
okay .
let 's end this way or that way !
get that second head looked at , wolfy .
is that all they 've died .
none can do what 's not wings you offer , but i ca n't touch this !
i pity the rest of your enemies do n't trip , oops ! okay ! do n't compare to me , they 're too busy making stupid high school plans .
finally , let 's go !
the essence of victory .
do n't embarrass me .
