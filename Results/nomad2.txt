to cover your legend . .
i want the filth of its conclusion . .
back in my claws ! !

all things ! ! become ! cut justice from it is to be whipped , immortality ! !
wolf strikes .
a scythe !
so he oughta give a way .
i knew it did he would really did this new master of kingdoms .
my footprints shall deliver it to you , abomination !
