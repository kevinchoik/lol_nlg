i guess i 'm done counting .
when memories fade and darkness surrounds you , find the strength inside .
a moving target lives longer .
imagine a place where it 's fight or flight , only now i call it home .
employing collateral damage .
i will not expect this !
nice reflexes .
let 's see ... yes , infinity more samples required !
bones are surprisingly inflexible .
their skins appear non-transferable .
