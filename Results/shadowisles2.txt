mankind drives us .
the west 's time .
pain is nothing to me .
this 'll be over soon .
wretched souls .
a bauble .
thresh . you are a doomed death will bless you are but no longer use you have a blade in .
your remains can endure ! ! my dear girl .
i left the end , it would stop us ?
lucian may forgive me . well , i ca not the number of darkness ? keep up ! not even gods , will stop they 're trying to kill me ?
