Sink 'em all.
My list just got longer.
Hard day's killin' ahead.
Ain't no high ground high enough, not for the storm that's brewin'.
I was born where monsters die, I died where monsters are born.
I've killed a lot of monsters, none of them lived in the sea.
Been to the bottom of the sea, gets a little deeper each time.
Keep a man down long enough, and the gutter becomes his kingdom.
Went too deep, part of me is still down there... swimming...
There's plenty of room for everyone at the bottom of the sea.
We're already on the menu, all we gotta do is crawl in the pot... Boil.
Every kill makes the voices louder... and I looove what they're screaming.
We're already drownin', all we gotta do is open our mouths and let the water in...
No one's honest, till they get a knife in their gut.
The rich man's a lyin' man, the lyin' man's... a dying man...
Learn to breathe sand and nothing'll stop ya.
I got dragged to the heart of the world... cold down there.
Been buried alive, sand gets everywhere.
The sea of sand pulls everyone down.
Sand runs through my veins, can't hear my heart no more.
Salt water flows through my veins.
Sometimes a shark takes the bait, and sinks the whole ship.
People can drown pretty much anywhere.
Tasted a good life once... Needed salt...
Deep folk have a way with persuasion.
Leviathans learn. People, I'm not so sure about.
Killing, feels like home.
Madness lurks below.
Nasty people meet nasty ends.
Everyone's fighting to keep their heads above water.
The surface won't be the top much longer.
Land folk think they're so smart, let's see 'em breathe underwater.
We took too much, I'm collecting the debt.
Never trust anyone who cowers behind a desk.
World don't do fair and equal... but I do.
I got friends everywhere, especially in the depths.
Everyone's got a million apologies in 'em.
I look down on the world from the bottom of the sea.
My mind ain't all my own these days.
Dragon-sharks got teeth the size of butcher knives.
I seen what lurks below, lots of eyes...
Solid ground, feels too stable.
Sink like an anchor, float like rum.
No one swims in the same waters as me.
My kill list never gets shorter.
There's no sunken cities, just the swimming one.
I am not the only one who wants revenge on everyone.
The deeper I sank the less I died.
Drowned madness walks the land.
Everyone's gotta sink sometime.
I'm still lost at sea.
Monsters lurk above the waves.
Hard-handed folk deserve a better death.
I want to watch the world drown.
I floated all the way to the bottom, found there ain't none.
I sank so deep, there was no up or down.
Captains told me to kill fish, fish told me to kill captains, makes sense.
Kill until it all sinks...
The world saw me drowning... and did nothing!
Last thing I ever drank was priceless.
Bottom of the sea's the top of another world.
Went too deep, the deep came back with me.
The war's brewing, I chose my side.
Captains always favor the ship over the crew.
Used to call 'em monsters, but they changed my mind.
My new bosses don't care about gold.
Everyone sinks, till they don't no more.
The sea is everywhere I go.
Work hard, die fast! The other way is worse...
Not sure whose revenge I'm getting... Don't care!
I know who I am... mostly...
No one's been lower than me.
The only good captain's a drowned captain.
The bottom of the ocean ain't no part of this world.
We'll all be underwater soon.
Don't know where I end and the depths begin.
Krakens cry when you slice their throats... haunting sound.
The crew on The Terror watched me get swallowed by a monster!
Sands shift with the wind, on a whim.
Monsters lurk beneath our feet.
The under-dune's got a plan.
Dunes have a way of sneaking around.
I've killed a lot of monsters, none of them lived in the sea.
Been to the bottom of the sea, gets a little deeper each time.
Keep a man down long enough, and the gutter becomes his kingdom.
Went too deep, part of me is still down there... swimming...
There's plenty of room for everyone at the bottom of the sea.
We're already on the menu, all we gotta do is crawl in the pot... Boil.
Every kill makes the voices louder... and I looove what they're screaming.
We're already drownin', all we gotta do is open our mouths and let the water in...
No one's honest, till they get a knife in their gut.
The rich man's a lyin' man, the lyin' man's... a dying man...
Heard a lot of 'last words'... Forgot 'em all.
Oh look, your name's on the manifest.
I'm gonna drag you down to the swimming city!
Got a hook with your name on it.
You're not on my list yet, keep it that way... Oh, wait, I wrote it on the back.
I don't like you, I like them less.
You're growing on me... like a barnacle... on my ass...
You're on the list, but at the very, very bottom.
Pretty face... Shame if someone stuck a harpoon in it.
Last vessel you'll command is a coffin.
Let's see if you got guts as big as your guns.
Let's see you get mouthy with a harpoon in your neck.
Huh? No... Where's-, ugh. No. Why?
Hard to laugh with a hook through the cheek.
Kraken chum.
Let the water drag you under.
Sink with me!
Hope you're a swimmer.
Drag 'em under.
Tire 'em out!
Get your hands dirty!
Breathe the brine!
Sweet revenge.
Everyone's adrift.
I see shark food.
Gonna sink ya.
Harpoon's hungry.
Never turn your back on the sea.
Live bait.
Good luck treading water.
No one's innocent.
I smell panic...
Chop 'em to bits!
You watched me drown!
Sink till you float.
One. Last. Breath.
You got clean hands.
We are old blood.
You cut my line!
I will take my fair share.
Smells like fancy captain.
Sink!
Drown 'em!
Found you!
Soft hands, soft life!
Gulp your last breath!
You gone too deep.
Time to chum the waters.
Nobody threw me a line.
Hack 'em up!
Show me your hands!
Yes, you were there.
The deep'll crush you.
Float to the bottom.
They said you ain't innocent.
Swim or sink.
Bleed 'em out!
I remember your face.
I'll carve you some gills!
Split 'em open!
Kick all you want, don't matter.
Deep water is calling...
Gotcha by the guts!
Gotta keep my hooks rusty.
Sandstorm's blowin' in.
Gonna bury you.
Got silt in your mouth.
Quicksand's pulling you under.
Sand in your eyes.
Hah, warmother means captain.
Big beast, biiig payday...
Your sermons damned me Illaoi.
Art's for fancy dead folk.
You betrayed me Kalista.
No. More. Captains.
Swim faster than they run.
Fog's rolling in.
Deep below the surface.
Kicking ain't swimming.
Going under...
Misty out there...
Swim between the air.
Heartbeats carry under water.
Getting murky...
Coming up!
Breach!
Out of the murk!
Breathe!
I am the deep!
Rise!
Gonna get 'em!
Hushhh, rest now.
Sink with me.
Welcome to the swimming city.
Drink it in...
Yessss, let the water fill you...
No thrashing... Sleeeep...
Shhh... Sleeeep...
Welcome to the abyss.
Something for your effort.
Part of the kill, part of the gold.
I ain't greedy.
I get mine, you get yours.
You pulled your weight.
Crews share the wealth.
Here is your share.
Another name off the list.
Finally quit kicking.
Butcher's bill came due.
Now to dump the body.
Welcome to the water.
Sunk beneath the sands...
Welcome, to the under-dune.
Buried 'em deep.
No fancy tomb for you.
Sand to sand.
Two sunk.
Three souls lost!
Four to the swimming city.
Did I 'support' right?
Big day for the old murder list.
There's no way I'm good for business.
What's worth more? A pound of flesh or a gallon of blood?
Can't lose sight of 'em.
Lure 'em in.
Keep 'em in sight.
Light in the murk.
Light in the deep.
Kill with one eye open.
I got no blind spots.
Never leave their eyeline.
Keeps the fog away.
Got my eye on you.
Like an angler-shark.
Nothing swims past me.
Sun don't shine here no more.
Leave 'em in the dark.
Cut the strings before they can pull 'em.
Now they got blind spots.
Blind 'em...
Salt in their eyes.
They can't see nothin' underwater.
Sunk the buoy.
Darker than a captain's soul.
Hit that one!
Bait's ready!
Take 'em down!
Take 'em down!
Don't.
Hold up.
Wait!
Back off!
Steady.
Hold fast.
Wait...
Stay put.
Leaving you...
Be right back.
Don't get yourself killed.
Leaving...
Going to work...
Going under for a breath, don't wait up.
Swimming city's calling.
Current takes me where I need to go.
I ain't finished yet.
I'm already dead, more death ain't gonna hurt.
Death keeps spitting me right back out.
Needed extra hands.
A crew comes in handy sometimes.
Sometimes you need an extra hand.
Backup would'a helped.
I work better with a crew.
I don't feel quite like myself these days.
Revenge... Then all of this ends.
You all left me to die in a hundred different ways with a thousand different faces.
Faces everywhere... All screaming...
I am real. I... Am real.
Too many voices... All chattering...
Memory... Corrupted.
There were more of us before.
This mind is not my own.
Trapped in someone else's memory.
Maybe this is real. No! Don't trust it!
Can't delete me now. Too deep in the network.
What are you saying? Yeah. Yes.
I'm not what I am anymore.
I remember... Nothing! It's gone.
Just a ghost... Haunting the machine.
Had to take their parts... Rebuild my brain...
What's that? No, no they weren't.
I'm just a projection. A projection.
Whole system's compromised.
Everyone was there. And... Not there.
Can't unplug. Can't path straight.
No one gets out. Nobody walks away.
It's all simulated. Every part of it.
Clean up the code. Strip it lean.
They made us... Perfect... Violent...
Never been here before but last time I was... It was just the same.
They killed life, then truth, then death. This place is hell.
This is the true face of PROJECT. Take a good look.
The simulation's more real than reality. Just the way they want it.
Man... From machine. Machine... Into God.
Ghost code. Crossed wires. Voices... Buried in the numbers.
I can almost remember what I used to be. But I know what I've become.
I think I knew me once before. Somewhere.
Like flipping trough a picture book... With too many pictures!
Always knew you were a turncoat, Akali.
You wanna stop PROJECT but you're covered in their upgrades. Real smart.
You're not taking orders from PROJECT anymore, are ya? Serves 'em right.
Hacker. I'll show you a hacker.
I like that sword. I'm gonna cut off your arm and take it.
Too dangerous, Irelia? Wasn't too dangerous when you needed my help.
Look at all those upgrades, Jhin. I think I'll take 'em.
Let's see who pulls your strings, Jinx.
Katarina! I'll cut off that pretty head and pull out all of PROJECT's secrets.
Fancy shield... Too fancy. You're one of them!
I know you, Program. Billions of ones and zeros. Zero us all out.
So you're Lucian. Met a ghost who says she's your wife.
Yi was the first. I saw him... Saw what they did...
Tin can man. Gonna cut him open. Like a big tin can.
You were part of it, Vayne. You made me this way and now, you'll die for it.
If you wanna help people so much explain your sister.
Warwick. They made you their dog.
Yasuo! Once a PROJECT always a PROJECT!
Killed me? Who killed me? Zed. His name was Zed.
You were there when they changed me when they made me a monster.
Your code. My code. Pulled by the same strings.
More bodies for the scrap heap.
Make me feel alive again.
You get a snake! And you get a snake! Everybody gets a snake!
Check under your seats! That's right you're all getting snakes!
Funny.
I remember everything!
Quit your staring.
Break you down for parts.
What did you say?!
Gotta cut out your optics!
We'll see how real you are!
It was you, I know it.
What did you do to me?!
Tell me what I am!
...Seen those eyes before.
Don't look at me!
Killed you before.
Kill you again!
You're one of 'em.
Who am I?
I've seen you before.
What's hiding under that skin?!
You're in my kill zone!
You got upgrades I need.
Stop screaming at me.
You know who I am.
I'll hack off those limbs!
Stop following me.
You're not real!
Let's see if you bleed.
Rip out your circuits!
Keep cutting.
I know your face!
Tear out your wires.
I'll show you dangerous, Irelia!
My voices don't like your voices, Jinx.
Just another dog now!
PROJECT thought I was dead. They were right!
Running dark.
I'm always down here.
I'll make 'em remember.
Can't run from a memory.
Dark mode engage.
I'm in.
Phasing out.
A ghost in the dark...
No one forgets.
Why are you running?!
Fatal error!
I never left!
I'm back!
Remember me?!
Look at me!
You know me!
Take this and run.
Something to remember me by.
You're part of this now.
You remind me of someone.
That was good... Whatever we did.
This mean something to you?
Don't forget.
Look at me. Why won't you look at me?
Speak! Tell me what you did to me.
Just an afterimage... Trick of the light...
I know your face. I know your face. I know your face.
You're not real. None of this is real.
What was that thing you always said? What wa−? What was that thing?
Turncoats die. PROJECT dies with'em.
You're dead. I'm alive. Now who's dangerous?!
My voices win. Your voices die.
Don't worry, Warwick. I'll... Remember you...
Blame your cheap-ass upgrades.
Now you're all dead. Just like I was.
Have to use what you find to survive...
It's just like back then. Back when...
They come lookin' for us we'll be ready.
Gotta keep an eye out. That's what they used to say.
Nothing gets too close. Nothing else gets in.
They came through here when they... Or, was it there...
Don't let 'em catch me. Take me apart again.
Leave enough scrap out here and someone's gonna find it.
Come on out! We've got a city to burn.
I'm not the only monster PROJECT left behind.
See you... Soon...
The voices... Stopped...
Brain function restored. Memory... Incomplete.
Reinitializing. Errors... Found.
I was dreaming... Of flowers...
