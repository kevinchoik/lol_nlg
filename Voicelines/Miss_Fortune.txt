Fortune doesn't favor fools.
Not a problem.
Step to.
Not a problem.
I know what I'm doing.
Set sail!
Sure you can handle me, summoner?
You've got dangerous eyes... I like that.
Don't get cocky.
I've got a good feeling about this.
Watch your mouth kid, or you'll find yourself respawning at home!
How do you like my guns... Shock, and Awe!
The fun begins.
Nothing but powder monkeys.
I always shoot first.
No prey, no pay.
Guns blazin'.
Bang!
A girl, a galaxy, and some names on a list. Isn't that how it always starts?
Greetings! Your arsenal of death is now available.
Hmm, no one's walking away from this clean.
Prepping blood scrubbers.
This is a friendly reminder to aim for vital organs and exposed heads.
Thanks, mom.
Prepping for terrestrial combat.
How terrestrial are we talking?
Extremely!
Look who showed up, a name to cross off the list.
There's an exo out there. I'm gonna need a bigger gun.
Always happy to kill.
Enemy exo detected. All safeties disengaged.
Anybody you know?
I do not talk about my life friends with my work friends.
I kill for sport, business, pleasure... Sometimes all three.
I always check their bodies, wouldn't want a pissed off exo-pilot hunting me forever.
I want revenge or death... Nothing else.
Maybe they die today, maybe they die tomorrow... But if I'm coming for 'em, they're gonna die.
Nothing like a smoking corpse and a paycheck.
Looks, charm, and enough ammunition to level a city!
Everybody wants to be in my firing line.
They should've finished me off when they had the chance.
I didn't die then and I won't die now, but somebody will.
Always room for another chip on my shoulder!
Do I look like I'm interested in talking it out?
Some folks deserve to die... And I deserve to kill 'em.
It's me and my exo-skeleton against the world! Worlds, if you have to split hairs.
This doesn't end until the last body hits the floor.
Nowhere to run, no time to cry.
The galaxy is full of bad people, I'm bad for the right reasons.
A lot of targets think they can best me... Until they don't!
With  Sarah Fortune, it's always personal.
The last thing to go through their heads will be this smile... or a bullet... or a particle beam... maybe some teeth.
Kill me once, shame on you. Kill me twice... Nobody kills me twice.
Stack the bodies, count the cash.
Everyone pays, and this goddess aims to collect.
Tell me I'm just a pretty face, I dare you.
I'm the most wanted woman in the universe... In more ways than one.
Clean kills are fine... but not all that fun.
There are lots of bad guys... good thing I've got a lot of bullets!
A lifetime ago I wouldn't even touch a gun! Then some people tried to kill me... Changes your perspective.
Space is quiet, so if you wanna make a name for yourself... You gotta be loud!
I have an on-again, off-again relationship with collateral damage.
Shoot first and there are no questions later!
You know what they say about big guns... Big bullets.
Revenge served cold loses its flavor.
Half the fun is letting them know you're out there.
Let's tear this place apart.
Get an eyeful of this chassis!
Every bullet is a gift, and I'm in a giving mood.
You can't keep a vengeful girl down!
War taught me two things, how to shoot, and how to win.
If they're real nice, I'll let them touch the suit.
Out here, there's no justice but my justice.
Pretty lady in a suit, weapon of mass destruction, what's the difference really?
Every suit is my strong suit.
I'm just a lonely girl piloting the galaxy's deadliest super weapon.
Nice day for some payback!
Oh they'll see me coming, I guarantee it.
I'm gonna clean this galaxy from the inside out!
Anomalous behavior detected, please enjoy your revenge.
Reminder! Avoid cauterization for maximum injury!
Searching for enemy class; weak and pathetic.
Recalli... brating
Scanning for cowards!
Uploading blood splatter suggestions.
Moving to... aṭlaqa n-nāra f-al-ḥufra!... new location.
My database says this is a form of teambuilding.
Reminder! The eye is the windows to the brainstem.
I've got more firepower than I know what to do with!
Blow up that tree!
Quiet.
Nobody ever got what they wanted playing by the rules.
You have broken galaxtic law 2587 times.
And I get what I want.
Anyone gunning for this girl better be ready!
), a planet-cracking gun.
EXO, how's my night look?
Your nightly schedule includes flirting, followed by extreme violence.
Nobody crosses an exo-pilot!
You cross almost everyone you meet!
They love it.
The horrors of war have made me psychologically unstable.
I don't think you're unstable.
Why thank you. Gracias. Spasibo bolshoye. Shukran jazīlan. Danke schön.  Arigatou gozaimasu.
I respect your insatiable lust for revenge.
It's more revenge than lust.
Respect levels rising!
Careful, that ego looks fragile. Wouldn't want to bruise it.
So who makes the first move? My left trigger? My right trigger? Or you?
You've got dangerous eyes, but not as dangerous as mine.
Please... my EXO could beat you.
I now have dreams and aspirations.
And you look great!
You look strong... Want my number?
Her number is a thirty-seven-hundred pound low-altitude missile.
Ask me for my number.
Coward detected!
I didn't need you to tell me that.
Watch and learn but mostly just watch.
Where I come from, we don't have catty space dragons and we like it that way.
I try to forget that a thousand years of space junk is floating around forever... then I run into something like you.
That thing can't stop me.
Unknown alloy door appears indestructible.
Can we shoot around the door?
Yes!
Its a suit. Not a lifestyle choice. How do you even walk?
Temporal Flux Detected. Faint traces of wasted youth, small dreams, zero imagination.
You remind me of a species that went extinct... must be lonely.
You look a lot like a guy who shot me in the head. Good for me, bad for you.
Analyzing facial hair. Analyzing offensive weapon. Analyzing body odor.
I'll take my suit against your god any day of the week.
Today is Tuesday.
Quiet!
Another assassin after the big bounty, huh? Let's go. I bet that mask is worth something.
Is that thing alive? Ugh! This suit is even worse than the other one!
Shoulder Pads are a power move, Kai'Sa, and you can't pull 'em off.
Something smells like machine grease and hard times... oh look, its Kai'Sa!
Inferior exo detected.
Ouch!
It is not an insult, it is a fact.
Where'd you get that deathtrap? Confederate Alliance? Royal Military ? Junk Planet ?
If I wanted help with my revenge, the last thing I'd ask is a singing catfish in a hat.
I don't like card tricks at the bar and I don't like card tricks now.
Calculating 98.7% chance of glorious robot army turning on its master. You must be so excited!
Stay out of space, kid. Start a blog like everyone else.
You spawned in the wrong neighborhood, star monster!
Handsome Dude
Watching my own bounty go up is more exciting than you.
I've seen your type before. Killed all my friends. So nothing personal, but you gotta go.
Integration of virtual intelligence sadly incomplete. You are better off dead... which we will make you!
Nothing turns me off more than a half baked sewer city.
Sorry I couldn't hear you over my superior... everything.
Reminder! Taunting intelligent weapon platforms is highly discouraged.
EXO, tell me a joke.
You installed an unshackled AI on the deadliest weapon in known space.
Is that a joke ?
It is very funny.
EXO, tell me a joke.
The human spine is 18 inches long and easily shattered by weapons fire.
Thank you EXO.
You are welcome!
What did the criminal say to the bounty hunter?
What did they say?
'Oh god! You shot me! Please, I will turn myself in! No! No! No!'. Sound of gunfire. 43 seconds of recorded silence.
Reminder! Jokes should be funny!
My body count has starships in it... Try me!
Service with a smile!
Catch!
Ya messed with the wrong pilot.
Bang!
Trigger pulled!
A little space justice!
Try smiling more!
Don't make me come over there.
Thought you liked trouble!
I'll give it a shot.
Let me top that off!
A little extra juice!
You should've run.
You trust your eyes too much!.
Even gravity can't slow me down.
Someone's cocky!
Don't look away.
Double the lead, double the dead.
Shoot first, cross off names later!
Vengeance with a smile!
Somebody needs some attention.
Revenge doesn't get itself!
Let's test that power fantasy!
Heads up buttercup.
I got you something.
Nice knowing ya.
Like what you see?
Too easy!
Don't blink!
More of me than you can handle.
Kiss, kiss!
I call dibs!
Is this what you wanted?
All eyes on me!
Nothing you can't handle.
Konnichi wa!
Solving for bone-shatter!
Here's a bullet.
Extrapolating meat burst.
Here you go!
Systems optimized... for fun!
Directing warning shot to enemy face.
Danke für Ihre Kooperation.
Ruki Vverkh!
We hope to attack you again!
Enjoy the great taste of bullets!
Have a wonderful day!
Enhancing killing potential.
Dispensing projectile!
I am EXO! And I love you!
Aim.
Fire!
Ready or not...
Here she comes!
Red and dead.
You want 'em. You got 'em.
Scarlet Fair!
Get 'em boys!
Feeding time!
Starswarm!
Big money! Big prizes!
Eat missle!
The Royal Arms!
Try a black hole!
The law of attraction!
Zero Hour!
Somebody's jealous.
That exo suit is so mine.
You don't deserve that hardware.
Engaging enemy exo skeleton.
Like 'em? They're a Miss Fortune original. One part, particle cannon. Two parts, nice lady.
Let's see how they like these girls.
They will not like these girls because they will be dead!
It'll rip their hearts right out of their chests! Literally.
Reminder gravity rounds are dangerously unstable. Aim for the heart!
You're so good to me.
Just what I've always wanted! A whole lot of missiles.
Military tech? Fun!
It is fun!
That's what I like to hear.
I won't bore you with the details but these stars are alive and they bite.
Integrating dangerous alien technology
Integrating.
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
Are we too good?
I do not know what too good means.
That one's on the house.
Careful. That second shot burns!
You're supposed to stand away from the bullets.
Ooo, that looked like it hurt!
Next rounds on me!
Remember the time we had together. I won't.
Just follow the bouncing bullet.
There I go killin' again.
Make mine a double.
Good rule of thumb. Never piss me off!
I love a good revenge story.
Rating situational awareness at sub-optimal.
Scrubbing name from revenge list.
I take tips.
Oops! My finger slipped.
Money in my pocket.
Sorry, little guy!
Now, let's try a real target.
Awww, I can't turn you in. You're full of holes.
Bang, bang. I shot ya down.
Thanks for the paycheck. Mwah!
You got my attention and I got my bounty. Everyone's a winner.
If it's any consolation, you were worth a lot to me.
Aww, you fell funny!
I'll always cherish our time together... until the money runs out.
Your galaxy thanks you.
Why thank you for your investment... in me.
Cash in hand, meet body in dirt. I think you'd get along.
Feels good to dispense a little justice. Well... not for you. You're dead.
Revenge served hot and fresh everyday.
Hey, you showed up to this party.
Take a minute. I'll wait.
This is just embarassing.
Somethin'... distracting you?
No... wait... stay...
Clean yourself up.
It's not you. It's me.
Sorry, buddy. It's just revenge.
Adding death scream to death scream archive.
Oy moroz, moroz, ni moroz menya.
Updating bounty board.
Enemy frustration levels rising.
Stars were made to fall.
I think that little jumpsuit needs a tune up.
Give it up, Kai'Sa. Seriously, I'm taking your suit.
Maybe next time, shoulder pads.
Don't lay it on so thick. Its unbecoming of a... you.
That felt good. Now for the real thing.
Justice! Right...
I'm a non-smoker.
I'm too old for fairytales!
Knives are so 32nd century.
Here's some sleight of hand. You're dead.
Another day. Another name off the list.
And that is why you never leave a girl for dead on her colony world.
Keep setting them up and I'll keep knocking them down.
I will mourn the death of... name deleted. No name on file.
Cleaning up the galaxy. Five dirtbags at a time.
Now scanning for additional dirtbags.
Oohh, say the words.
Repopulating bounty board.
Yes!
More guns, more glory.
Mmm, that's the stuff.
Dunno what it is, but I like it.
Everything's a bullet if you believe.
Integrating new hardware.
Updating plugins.
I guess I could... throw it at someone.
An essential part of any balance arsenal.
This is how you keep a bounty hunter off your back.
I love wreckin' someone's day.
My eyes on the ground.
Tactical party crasher acquired.
I can always use a drink.
Nice. My tactical beverage.
What is this mixed with?
This is room temperature.
Enjoy the great taste of... substance ID not found.
It'd sure be a shame if I just left this right here.
Keep an eye out for me.
You're gonna make someone very unhappy.
Of all the galaxy's junk, this is some of my favorite.
Wouldn't wanna get shot in the face and left for dead. Again...
Wish I'd had one of these back at the colony.
Do your job and I'll do mine.
A little active radar never hurt anyone.
I see you.
Now thwarting assassins.
At least they get to watch me leave.
Get a good look. Next time you see me, we won't be friends.
Exo, take us home.
Returning for upgrades, suit repairs, data corrupted, blood scrub.
Preparing to enter orbit.
Enter.
Shutting down...
Daisy, daisy...
Systems failing...
Last people who tried to kill me got crossed off my list. Let's give 'em the authentic gun goddess experience.
Every single one of them is dead.
I'll finish what they started.
If you're gonna leave a girl for dead, at least buy her dinner first.
Get revenge, get paid. In that order.
Greetings! Please select your bullet delivery apparatus.
Reminder! Revenge on your would-be killers is a refreshing way to start the morning.
Now running violent revenge protocols.
Who will fortune favor today?
Get those  oranges ready, Gangplank!
Don't get cocky. I'll be back!
