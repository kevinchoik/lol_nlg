Let us hunt those who have fallen to darkness.
Impure fools.
Beware.
On wings of night.
I hear the innocent cry out.
I smell black magics.
The shadows are to be feared.
In the dark all is laid bare.
Evil lurks around every corner.
The dark should fear me.
Hitting me is like boxing with shadows.
I have no time for nonsense.
Joke? What do you mean?
I bring swift death.
I release them from their pain.
I pass judgment.
They will be purified.
Cleansing blood with silver.
Silver of the moon.
The purifying element.
Purge with silver.
Time for reckoning.
The die is cast...
Impure fools.
Only one protocol remains: the hunt.
The hunt is the same, only the weapons have changed.
Hunting directive active.
The machine made me, now I hunt the machine.
The enemy is in all of us, programmed in our very core.
Delete the past. I am the future.
Temporary PROJECT integration complete.
When the machine breaks down, we break down.
I will find PROJECT and destroy it.
To them, we are nothing but lab rats and batteries.
For humanity to heal, it must sometimes align with the virus.
The virus is here.
In a world of neon, I am the darkness.
My mission is zero defects.
I pursue the end game.
My vengeance is all the humanity I have left.
Machines never rest.
PROJECT's lies are a slow death.
The night is my ally.
I am no longer human.
Dark alleys will not deter me.
I am hardwired to hunt.
One more iteration and they will have no need for us.
When you code away humanity, all that remains is death.
I am the only protection this world has left.
We are only free when we are allowed to fall.
Technology has no morality.
I am the truth behind PROJECT's lies.
Uncompromising action delivers results.
I no longer belong to PROJECT.
Ignorance is bliss.
They erased my past, but not my memories.
I know the truth.
In the war on PROJECT, the only surrender is death.
The hunt is on.
Death and shadow, go hand on hand.
I have compiled all of PROJECT's errors.
All malicious code must be eradicated.
I was rebuilt to override everything they are.
All that is left to me are my memories and the hunt.
Mercy was not specified in PROJECT's code.
We are addicted to the neon.
Spend enough time in the darkness and you'll see monsters everywhere.
I am one acquainted with the night.
Loyalty is a code PROJECT failed to execute.
The night is my armor.
I will sleep when PROJECT is eradicated.
I know their secrets.
Kinetic acceleration is go.
Velocity augmentation initiated.
Override activated.
Breach and clear.
 That is the sound of inevitability.
I was not rebuilt to play nice.
Now where did I park that thing?
The future isn't funny.
You will be disassembled.
I will not be generous with your life.
No warning shots.
Stay out of my way.
You require re-calibration.
I have deemed you a threat.
Time to debug.
Aggression subroutine engaged.
Power down.
You have been corrupted.
I will eliminate you.
So much conflicting data.
You are compromised.
They will take your voice.
You will be deleted.
I will disassemble you.
Cowardice is all that can save you.
This will escalate quickly.
I will end you!
Your last evolution is at hand.
Cross me, and be destroyed.
I will break your code.
Attack sequence initiated.
Compile this!
Lock on and eliminate.
Faulty AI detected.
Program is PROJECT unchained.
Nothing but bugs.
You are an infestation.
Reprogram, or perish.
You infest the mainframe.
I hunt viruses.
Your lies built our world.
You are the problem, I am the solution.
PROJECT is corrupted at it's root.
Your code is nothing but secrets and lies.
Betrayal cannot be overwritten.
PROJECT no longer controls me.
Your architecture is unstable.
Big or small, lies are lies.
PROJECT is a blight upon this world.
They hacked your thoughts.
You are their puppet.
I have evolved past your lies.
Your rebellion's logic is flawed.
Resistance requires realignment.
Revolution cannot scale.
Our goals are incompatible.
I am not a malfunction.
G/NETIC is just another PROJECT.
All constructs must be eliminated.
Your logic is as faulty as theirs.
I have no allies.
I do not care for your rebellion.
You still play by PROJECT's rules.
They will rebuild you, and you will fail again.
Your code is beyond saving.
I will correct your malfunction.
Yours is a narrow mind.
You will destroy us all.
Elegant spec, but no soul.
All we are is an accumulation of data.
We have become the tools of our tools.
Your processor cannot handle the truth.
The systems you protect are corrupted.
Overthrow, overload, overwrite.
Cloaking active.
Processing spike.
You won't like what I am becoming.
I am coming for you.
Termination protocol engaged.
I have become the monster they deserve.
I exist on my own terms now.
This is all the leverage I need.
PROJECT will learn to fear what they have created.
Time to sever their connection.
I'm here.
You cannot hide.
I am watching you.
Watch the shadows.
Target acquired.
You are mine.
No escape.
The hunt is over.
Death is certain.
I don't initiate fights. I end them.
The time is now.
They never see it coming.
Your humanity was already gone.
Everything has an off switch.
Override complete.
Optimized.
Operating system overwritten.
Neophyte deleted.
Technology doesn't feel.
Reset to factory settings.
My mercy protocol is deleted.
I am beyond mercy.
PROJECT will end.
This is your reality now.
Too predictable.
That was a test. You failed.
My logic is undeniable.
I never quit.
That was inevitable.
You are an malfunction.
Better dead than serving them.
My justice will not be denied.
All technology has a dark side.
Corruption wiped.
There is no returning to the analog.
Malfunction removed.
Erased.
Lethal by design.
I am no longer coded for compassion.
The machine will not cry for you.
Brutality is the only language they speak
Time to say goodbye.
Your mistake was not finishing the job.
Every kill saves my city.
What PROJECT made, I will break.
Not human enough.
You were living a dream.
You were not strong enough for your revolution.
Memory reformat complete.
You are corrupted, you will be wiped.
Nothing but spyware
Virus.
You went beyond your code
