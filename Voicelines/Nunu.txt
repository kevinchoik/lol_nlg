Every adventure is better with a friend!  
It's okay, we'll play later.
This way to... Adventure! 
And so they traveled, over mountains and glaciers. And this one time, there was a village full of people turned into stone!  We couldn't help them.  But we're gonna help everyone else!
Once upon a time there was a yeti, and a boy.  But this time I get to be the yeti! Roar! 
It's not a flute, Willump. It's a sword called Svellsongur!  Fine, I'll stick to snowballs.
 Uh-huh.  No way!  Woah, that's the best story my ears ever heard!  But... no one got hit in the face with a snowball.  'Til now! Got you, you big galumpa!  
Workshop? More like playshop!
We've come to eat candy canes and kick naughty list butt!  And everyone's on the naughty list!
We're gonna demolisherize you!  Uh, maulerate?  Marfigure?  Grr. The point is, you're not gonna find it very pleasant!
No more heroes! Now, it's crunchageddon!
Willump, I can't believe they had a t-shirt in your size! XL, as in extra limbs! 
It's Freljord Frost versus Azubu Frost!
Winning a championship is basically like saving the world.  That's why TPA are my heroes!
Uh-oh, I think Lissandra's mad at me.  But I won't let her hurt you, Willump!
If you could do anything, Willump, what would you do?  Scratch behind your ears?! That's not an adventure! 
Let's get in there and thwack some stuff!
Let's shake out some snow! 
I bet you three icicles I can fly, I just never jumped hard enough. 
Rumble, tumble, and- eh, scrumble! Willump loves to scrumble!  
This is just like in my favorite song! Only this time, it's about us!
Keep your eyes open for treasure. Like skulls, or rusty swords! Cool!
The only thing louder than Willump's steps is his snoring!  
A snowball is never just a snowball, if you believe in magic!
Sometimes the world's more interesting when you close your eyes. I see... globlins! Wow, they have warts, that's how you know they're bad guys.
You know what would be fun, Willump? Everything! If you're there with me! 
They only hurt people cause there's something sad in their hearts?  Then I'm gonna knock it out!
Don't be afraid, Willump!  I am not scared!  Maybe just a little... 
Last one there is a stinky old yeti!  Fine, magical too... 
The adventure continues!
How many words to yeti's have for 'snow'?  And for 'farts'?  I knew it! 
It's cold.  I'm glad you're here, Willump. 
It's okay to be sad sometimes, Willump. That's how you know when you're happy!
Battle is the song I came to sing!
Make way for the yeti!
Home is that way, Willump!
Willump knows the way!  He knows lots of stuff.
Go, team yeti!
We gotta find out what happens next, or I can never finish our song!  We can't be heroes without a song.
Are we there, yeti? Heheh, get it?  You're laughing on the inside, huh? 
Someone out there needs our help!
 Your fur's tickling me!
This day keeps getting more bizonkerific!
You can't give up if you're standing on a yeti! That's as up as it gets!
Let's put the venture, in adventure!
There's nothing to it, but to do it!
I bet we could have fun over there.
I eat heroic deeds for breakfast!  Willump prefers Krugs, all in one gulp...  Ugh.
Everyone knows heroes are brave, and they hit stuff really hard! But only I know the true secret.  No! Not that!
My mom's out there somewhere.  I can hear her, Willump. Every time I go to sleep... 
Playtime's never over!
I bet, if we stayed really still we become invisible!  I'll always see you, Willump. 
Let's make snow tracks!
Your steps are the rhythm!  And my flute's the melody!
Heroes don't need hugs.  Okay, they're not looking now. Bring it in, you big fursnarggle! 
Do your battlecry, Willump!  No, not that one! 
We're off like a dirty tunic!  That's what one of the elders used to say.  I wonder if he's alright.
Let's count our steps! Eleventy-seventy and one, eleventy-seventy and two...
Slow down, Willump! You're gonna cause an avalanche! Before I can! 
Ugh, old people always doom the world, so it's up to kids to save it!
Keep playing, Willump! No one can tell us not to! We already broke the rules with the super-mega punch!
I can't pronounciate your real name!  Well... you can't say Nunu either. 
Hurry, Willump! Sounds like they're in trouble!
The Freljord's greatest heroes on our way!
We're here to lend some fists!
Nunu and Willump to the rescue!
Let's bury 'em in snowballs!
Fear not, fellow adventurers!
Buckle your tunic, we're going in!
Woah. This. Is. Awesome!
Wow, too fast! The snot just froze to my nose!
Haha! Can't catch me!
Faster, Willump!
Haha! Yippeeeee!
The dragon's maw opened wide, and fire bloomed deep down inside. The hero saw a flash of teeth, and- Maybe I'll tell you what happened next time, Willump. 
The troll was fierce, his breath was cold. Not blood, but ice you would behold. To spill from wounds, the bites of steel. In flesh was hero's blade concealed! Being a hero is awesome!
A creature great, a mountain guard. A terrible monster its own past scarred. In ruin it rages and magic swirls, but its power once saved the world. Woah, that guy sounds cool! 
The witch hissed as her spell was spun. And heroes raised their voice as one. 'For glory, for freedom!' They joined the fight, but their cries were trapped in darkest ice. Lissandra taught me that one!
Ice, wind, spray of souls. Lay of seekers, the elder toll. Locked for eons, a frozen key. The power lies inside me!
We've told the tales of iron forged, we've cowered at the thunder's roar, but if you sail, the sister seek. Seal sister from the ocean speaks! Willump, I want to meet her!
The gods are gone, the world their forge. Now flames are gone, and words our torch. Against the cold, this song I sing, a spark of my own forging! Well, technically my mom's.
Steel flashed as it cut through air, and web guarding the spider's lair. Eight legs, covered in claws and hair. A web of danger, life ensnared!
Our caravan used to race Anivia all across the Freljord!
My mom said as long as I remember her, she'll always come back, like Anivia.
Braum? I knew you were real! Will you be my dad?
The vault door! I bet Ornn carved it!  What? That's not a spoiler!
I can be a hero too! I'll show everyone in the Frostguard!
I hope Lissandra's not mad. Her face might freeze that way.
It's not how you die, Olaf! It's how you live! Even I know that!
Uh oh, Willump. He's got two axes, one for each of us. 
Sometimes fighting can teach you things, like how to forgive your brother.
Ornn! My mom used to sing your song as the ashes died in the fire. It still makes me feel warm.
Definitely not a princess.
Believe in yourself, Tryndamere. And you won't need to  call people chickens behind their backs.
I wanna be a barbarian when I grow up!
Volibear! Uh, sorry! I mean, The Volibear. Or uhm, Mr. The Volibear, Sir...
Roaaaar! 
Why did the Frostguard cross the road? Cause he thought he was a-  Woah! You really don't like Frostguards.
Knock knock.  A Frostguard!  W- Willump! You're not supposed smash him!
A Frostguard walks into a mead hall and-  Woah! Not again!  Joke's on me, huh Willump?
We'll always win, 'cause we have something to fight for!  Not princesses! Gross! 
Willump's not a monster!
The best part of being a hero, is shouting out your catchphrase!
And a little of that! Pow!
Don't make me come down there and bonk you myself!
I learned how to fight from a song.  That's not weird, it's cool! 
Claws slash! Teeth chomp!
Put some claw into it, Willump!
 Yeah! What he said!
Saving the world is so much fun!
If we save the Freljord, everyone has to like us!
We don't wanna hurt you. 
Let's kick bad guy butt!  Cause they never wear butt armor!
These bad guys aren't gonna bruise themselves!
Meet my best friend, Willump!
Didn't anyone tell you? The bad guys never win!
Fear the wrath of Svellsongur!  It's not a flute! 
Watch out for his beard! You can get tangled up in it. 
What you're doing is wrong!
You were gonna hurt someone with that!
You bop and I'll boop, Willump!
It's not fighting if you're having fun!
I have sworn to vanquish all kinds of bad stuff, starting with your face!
Evildoers beware!
Something tells me they don't wanna hug.
I got your back, Willump! Woah! Almost fell off!
Before we can save the world, first we gotta see it!
Mess with the yeti and you get the boy!
I don't know what 'dastardly' means, but I'm gonna punch it!
Lord Grompulus, Kevin Ribbiton of Croaksworth, your unjust reign ends here!
Think Gromp's actually a princess?  I'm not kissing her!
The fairy's voice was coming from over here! I bet that Gromp swallowed her!
Gah! We've been poisoned, Willump! The only cure is to kick Gromp's butt!
Let's Gromp it up!
These krugs don't look happy to see us... They must be up to something, Willump!
You think the krugs turned all those people into stone?  There's only one way to find out!
If you see a Krug's shadow, that means there's gonna be an earthquake.
The frost troll will never leave the village if we don't get rid of the Krugs. He's scared to step on them.
Sorry, Krugs. Willump says I gotta fight you to learn multiplicationing.
Are you sure they're really raptors? Or are they void monsters in disguise?  Pluck their feathers, Willump!
We gotta stop the raptors before they become evil raptosaurs and try to eat the sun!  What? It could happen. 
What a big beak you have, Mrs. Raptor. You're gonna use it to hurt people, aren't you?
That old man in the cave asked us to kill exactly ten raptors.  I don't remember why.
Don't hold back, Willump! They stole this nest from those wraiths we talked to!
The wolves are howling so much the moon can't sleep at night. Let's muzzle them, Willump.
I'm gonna play a song so loud these wolves will lose their stinky breaths trying to howl over me!
Murk Wolves, I come to fight you in the name of your archenemies! Murk Cats!
Don't let them bite you, Willump, then you'll turn into a were-yeti! Wait, that would be awesome!
The boy who cried wolf? That's not me. I never cry!
He's sucking up all the blue in the world! We gotta stop him, Willump!
Tell us what happened to the sentries, blue guy! Or someone's gonna get hurt!
Beat up a bunch of tiny goobers, then you can fight the boss!
We will banish you from this valley, rock-skin boulder-man!
A stone sentinel! He must be guarding something, like a secret!
Willump can't stop seeing red! What did you do to him, Brambly?
The princess will never wake up, unless we can find a bramble rose.
I heard what you did in Kumungu, Brambleback!
Brambleback! It was you all along! Well, your evil deeds end here!
Cinders in his heart. A sure sign of evil, Willump.
Uh oh. 
Stay close, Willump.
I can do this! Huh!
A real dragon?! 
Why are there never any snow dragons?  Oh yeah, we can make one.
Lift me higher, Willump! So I can punch it in the nose!
Cloudy with a chance of dragon!
Infernal? Sounds evil to me!
You're in a mountain of trouble!
Can't be any worse than a sea serpent!
One dragon to rule them all!
Don't close your eyes, Willump. We've gotta face this. 
I really don't like monsters!
Songs aren't usually this... scary.
This is gonna be the biggest snowball ever!
Here we go!
Gigantulossal snowball!
I just realised... Snowballs don't have brakes!
Yetiiii power!
Oh, one too many snowballs.
We didn't wanna hurt you, that's why we used snow.
Hurting people isn't fun, Willump. Is that why it's so hard to be a hero?
Playing dead is still playing, right?  Oh...
Big MiSTakE!  Get it?  That's a players name! 
I know I should be happy, but it feels lonely, Willump.
Fairy? Are you in there...? Whoa. Disappeared.
Apologies, m'lady. We'll find a way to un-toadify you.
May the crown pass to a more worthy Croaksworth. Like Tim! Or Jerry. Or Jeff. Or um... Hm.
Phew! I've never gromped so hard in my life!
That was a weird cure. I hope I read the scroll right.
We should go back to the village, Willump. Maybe the curse is lifted?
Frost troll! Your feet is safe now!
Willump, you didn't have to shake the earth yourself. 
That was your mistake, Krugs. We never take evil for granite.
That's what you get for teaching numbers!
Sun's still shining, guess that means our work is done. 
 You say everything tastes like raptors. 
The other kids said I had a big beak once. 
Maybe now the wraiths can come home!
Oh yeah, the old man's gonna make pants out of the raptors beaks and stuff.  I don't know how.
Oh no, you bit them, and now they're yeti-wolves! Awooo!
And though the song has ended, it echoes in our hearts! 
Uh oh... if the moon sleeps at night, it won't shine anymore! Guess we better do the howling! 
I'm more of a murk-yeti-kid myself. 
I'm gonna miss those pupsters, Willump.
No one's the boss of me!  I hope Lissandra didn't hear that.
Sometimes blue is the only color in the Freljord. I remember my mom had blue eyes...
You shouldn't abandon your best friends!
Next time you'll remember, it's not nice to keep secrets!
Crumble under the weight of your infamy!
Now there's nothing but ash, evil ash!
And once again the village was saved thanks to the one and only Nunu!  Fine, Willump helped. 
 You should've just said you were angry. 
But maybe it was Ivern's fault.
No flowers on this one! We've gotta keep looking!
High three, Willump!
Rift scuttled!
Yeah! Go back to the void, you crabbybutt!
They were just defending their home. Why don't the songs ever mention that?
Looks like we got... under his scales.
I like watching clouds, but it's even better fighting them!
Spicy! I said spicy! Haha.
We beat up a mountain! Woah!
Salty.
More like, elderly dragon! 
At first I was afraid, but then I felt the snow became ice. What's happening, Willump?
Some say, the beast's cries can still be heard whenever you taste purple.
Am I crazy, or was that monster more afraid of me? 
Up high, Willump!
Secret. Hero. Handshake! Yeah!
Best friends forever!
They lived happily ever, after all!
Can't lose hope, Willump! The Freljord is counting on us!
 I missed you too, Willump!
I didn't think you were dead! I could see you breathing!
Did we just die, Willump? Let's do it again!
No wonder they're so angry, they forgot to bring snowballs!
Magic tickles.
Awesome!
We did it, Willump!
Here comes the boom!
Perfect timing! Must be from all the songs.
Boom!
Smell you later bad guy!
Snowball away!
Snowsplosion!
Go, snowball! Go!
Welcome to the Rift Wars. That's what I'll say as I walk forward in slow motion and all my enemies explode behind me.
WILLUMPBOT online. I thought you would want to know.
Formulating strategy: Towerdive.
My friends know me as Workframe Integrated Lossless Lifeform Uploaded Mainly for Punching, but you can call me Willump.
I will ponder the true meaning of friendship Nunu, while punching these noobs until all of their 1s are 0s. 0s. 0s. 0s. 0s. 0s. 0s0s0s0s...
I'm starting to think maybe friendship's a bug.
Here is my brilliant plan:
Step 1: Towerdive
Step 2: Towerdive
Step 3: Wait for it... Towerdive
Can you obey this protocol, Nunu?
Eh, it's kinda complicated. Why don't we just towerdive?!
It is the year 20XX, a young boy named Nunu hacks into RiotCorp's systems, and finds some old AI code from the game, League of Legends.
ERROR. ERROR.  ERERERERERERERERROR.
Now that RiotCorp rules the world, we all gotta fight in the Rift Wars. It's my robot against yours.
Summoner. Sum-sum-suuu- Summoner.
Um, just give me a second.
You think my mom is in the crowd tonight, Willump?
Error, no result found. Try putting your search in quotations.
GLHF!
That means good luck, human fleshbags.
WILLUMPBOT speaking.
Welcome to the Nunu Champion Spotlight, presented by WILLUMPBOT.
I will intimidaaaa them with my rock-hard robot bod.
E-sports.
My ultimate will devastate them, or not.
Fewer that 1% of players are banned for toxicity. That's what you call elite.
I can't be scripting, because I'm a robot.
Towerdive.
Do I, Do IIIIII.
I am so awesome, I have  Flash on D and F.
I need 6 more  RP for Star Guardian Urgot.
I will push forward and make my boldness known.
I will now do a dramatic reading from... ERROR- an  Ezreal fanfiction.
Challenger is only a state of mind, Nunu. And a sweet jacket.
Bots are superior to non-bots.
Inside my circuits, I am clicking furiously.
I will surprise them with my decision.
Scanning for intelligence  none here.
My strategy is so advanced, they will need a new patch to access it.
I must think, and act fast.
Man, I am good.
Walking, so compelling, so gameplay.
Don't call me a skin, I'm all metal baby.
This way to: Challenger league.
They'll know I'm the best hacker ever when they see how fast I can type!
I know my mom is out there, and she gonna see us do something awesome!
Woah! Eleventy billion people are watching the stream. Don't screw up Nunu, don't screw- Aargh!
I can make anything if I have enough scrap, and if I hit it hard enough with my wrench!
I wonder what League of Legends was like, I bet it was fun and people loved it, and they never ever complained!
Running friendship subroutines.
Whoohoo!
Canceling. It's more fun towerdiving.
Everything is going according to my plan.
Hey! I'm the one with the control sticks!
I love you Willump.
You're not my real dad.
Willump is my best friend.
I am the best at everything.
Zoom.
I have a need for speed.
There is a movement speed cap? Lame.
Hold onto your keyboard.
Hey look, I'm a motorcycle. Vroom.
Transformerate!
Awesome mode, engage!
This is why I installed handlebars!
Time to win the Rift Wars!
Too pretty!
Your name is inaccurate, you can neither blitz nor crank. I will call you Grabshock.
An outdated model.
Hello Blitzcrank, have you managed to exterminate anything today?
Be careful! Lee Sin can kick you from across the world!
Master Yi, you kill very fast, and are honorable.
Watch out! He has sword boots!
You have dangerous eye-eye-eye-eye- guns.
Did you see all the bugs beneath that guy's armor?
I relate to your lore so intimately. Not you, Nautilus, your suit.
Another Ryze rework in 3... 2... 1.
Sometimes life is so good, it's fun to imagine you're lame and bald.
Woah! A hamster piloting a mech! The Rift Wars are awesome!
Oh, hi Marc.
Tryndamere won't die, he must be hacking.
Love me some Tryndamere.
Can't killean the Zilean.
There is an action movie somewhere that wants its mech designs back.
Super Robot Wars, begin.
I am all the robot RiotCorp needs.
Kawaii desu!
Tibbers Bot never talks, guess he's not as awesome as you Willump!
I love Pug'Maw, he fits perfectly in my compactor.
Your ELO is so low, it is the word boosted.
Woooah! I found an old model in your code.
That was not me. That was... Anivia bot.
Cool! An old robot.
Please avert your visual sensors Nunu.
Woah! Jankerific!
It was only a phase, I swear.
I am a robot, hear me roar. Roar.
Multi-core processing allows to punch and flex at the same time.
I will compress their data, with punches.
Never not be punching.
For your consideration: Punching.
Enemy destruction-  will happen soon.
I am the best.
The fourth law in robotics... is punching.
You will feel my rage now.
You're now on my ignore list.
Rock 'em and sock 'em.
Don't frag me bro, I was just defragmented.
Fleshbags are an inferior form factor.
Witness my superior playstyle and see it.
Put your right fist in, take your right fist out. Put your left fist in, now they are dead.
I have a bad feeling about this.
Worship me as your shiny metal god.
Towerdive. We must towerdive.
Oh the damages! The damages!
Chickety check yourself before you get wrecked yourself.
This will level me up!
Let's wrencherize them!
I'm in your code, hacking your healths.
Turn 'em into spare parts, Willump!
/dance on them haters.
Always be punching.
I make the Rift Wars look good.
Time to Rift War!
Gimme all your league points and no one gets hurt.
Ultra Mega Basic Attack!
The crowd demands robot-on-robot violence Willump!
Processing complete.
What is it, Willump?
I have learned the true value of friendship: 43.
My master tactics will win.
Press 1 to talk to a representative. Press 2 for punches.
I choose 2.
We're gonna have to bust some bolts Willump.
Did someone say towerdive?
Someone tell those monsters they are trash, I can't because I am chat restricted.
Those guys were worthless. Get dunked.
Not so rude now, are you?
Boosted animals.
Welcome to the Destroyed Monster club, appreciate it alot.
Yummy. Delicious.
Farming complete.
1000 AP one-shot.
Jungling is so easy.
They had no chance to survive.
My superior skills have triumphed once more.
Now watch and learn from my moves, as I learned from FakerFan420.
Now you will see what happens when you listen to my superior plans.
Monsterdive. We must monsterdive.
You got me an epic monster, Nunu? You shouldn't have.
Now watch as this intense boss battle unfolds.
The bigger they are, the more fun it is to stuff them into my compactor.
This monster makes me angry, it will not like me when I'm angry.
To damage, or not to damage. Let me thi-thi-thi-thi- to damage.
Another epic battle in the Rift Wars, against a toad.
I eat my Gromps with catchup experience.
Gromps get stomps.
I think I stepped in  Malphite poop.
Krug life.
Krugs. No one knows what you guys are. You are rocks.
1v1 me. You can't. You're a raptor.
Squawk squawk.
Looks like Raptor is back on the menu.
Alpha wolves? You aren't even in beta, this'll be easy.
Doggos intensifies.
Bite me.
The power to win was inside us all along. That's what I'll say after we get blue buff.
An interesting fact about sentinels, no one ever calls them sentinels.
Gimme dat buff, I need dat buff.
Only you can prevent forest fires, by killing Red Buff.
Party in the front, brambles in the back.
Brambleback is dangerous because he is red.
Let's punch this dragon now.
A dragon is no match for my pneumatic fist.
So majestic, so peaceful. Let us destroy it.
Wrath Damage. Worm Attack.
Be careful! You do not know where those tentacles have been.
I will punch this baron through the fourth wall to say hello to players.
Rolling it down mid.
All it takes is a spark!
It's all coming together.
Time to battle bots.
Do that thing with that thing Willump!
Oh how the cheers of the crowd warm my circuits. Wait, I'm just overheating.
Now I am the Super-bot.
These guys are free.
Their tears are fully stacked.
I am become Death, Destroyer of Noobs.
XD. True damage.
Another step closer to Challenger league! Woo.
And the crowd goes wild! Ahhh! Ahhh! Wow we love you, yay!
Willump-mania runs wild!
I can finally towerdive without noobs getting in the way.
THIS IS THE BESTEST THING THAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO ME!
I am not crying, it's blue essence.
You're all coins now!
I have taught you well Nunu.
I'm so clutch I have one on my head.
They were no match for punching.
Let's go.
Even epic monsters are 3 megabytes at most.
The surprise twist is finally revealed: We were the monsters the whole time.
Epic lolz.
Gigabit.
Now we have the  blue circle, which looks really sweet.
That tingles.
Now we have the  red circle, which looks sweet and helps us kill faster.
Overclocking enabled.
Sick burn.
I knew we could do it Willump!
Dragon down, Dream Drop Destruction!
That Dragonslayer module finally came in handy!
I guess that put a wrench in their plans, eh?...
Just a boy and his robot, doing boy and robot stuff.
Should've unplugged when you had the chance, robo-worm!
The Rift Wars will return after these hypno-messages.
Today's punching brought to you by RiotCorp.
Will Nunu find his mother and conquer the rift? Stay tuned.
01100010
01101111
Cut the video.
01101110
WILLUMPBOT has disconnected.
I promise I won't tilt this time Nunu, I don't want you to fall off.
Lag.
Apply wrench directly to the forehead!
That feels better, Nunu.
Recalibrating...
Towerdive!
Oh yeah!
Don't worry Willump, if we fail, I can always rent my brain out to RiotCorp.
 You already said that! It's like you're repeating things randomly.
Uh oh! I think his logic circuits broke.
 At least he didn't say towerdive... WAIT!
 That's my best friend!
 You're funny Willump.
 Lolzers.
Oooooooh!
Wow, I really got to get his circuits checked.
 Sometimes robots are weird.
Burgle.
Floorboard.
Defenestration.
Capricorn.
Pantaloons.
Jelly bean.
Xylophone.
Yes, I survived Season 8.
Sassafras.
Blunderbuss.
Hi mom.
Aardvark.
Shikaka.
Bicycle.
Tadpole.
Dongle.
I was forged in the flames of all-chat.
Weevil
Archipelago.
Tulip.
Eggplant.
Sasquatch.
I hope my mom is watching!
Buttress.
Hubcap.
Tingly.
Tardigrade.
Rito Plsssss.
Something random.
Whoop whoop.
Elevator.
Penguin.
Anitiquing.
I feel stronger, faster, more armier.
I finally have the energy I need to buy more gems for Rift War Mobile.
