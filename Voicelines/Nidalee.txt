They will fear the wild.
Mmm, the taste of coward.
I will guide you.
Let me show you the way.
On the prowl.
You call this civilized?
You cannot cage me, summoner.
Instinct guides my steps.
Here mousy, mousy, mousy...
Did I mention it's mating season?
Claw or spear, your end's the same.
Mmm, the taste of coward.
We'll prey on the civilized.
I'll show these house cats real claws.
The untamed know no fear.
I love playing cat and mouse.
I see you're no stranger to the wild.
