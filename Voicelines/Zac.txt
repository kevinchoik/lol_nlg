I was made for this... literally.
Well, now I'm just mad.
Let's bounce!
Why thanks! I do work out.
How's it goin'?
Everybody's a critic.
Put some spring in your step.
I'm not as squishy as I look.
Fighting is in my blood... I mean... my goo.
I may bend, but I don't break.
Mom always said I was big for my age.
There's plenty of me to go around.
I could really use a snack right now.
I should get a suit.
I never skip breakfast.
Just another day on the job.
It's not how much you can lift. It's how good you look!
Go big... or go home!
This is gonna get messy.
Time to introduce myself.
Knock it off.
Well, now I'm just mad.
These jerks don't know when to quit!
Pick on someone your own size.
Don't be such a stiff.
Back off, pal.
I'm done being nice.
Don't push your luck, champ.
Someone's about to get hurt.
Hey, sorry about the pain.
No need to be mean.
Beat up, or beat down? I'm flexible.
Not again.
I hate it when this happens.
Look what they did.
Keep it together.
Whoa!
Incoming!
Woohoo!
Squashing time!
Heads up!
