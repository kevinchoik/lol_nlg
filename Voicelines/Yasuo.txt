Death is like the wind - always by my side.
No cure for fools.
Whispers in the wind speak of a masked swordsman with two blades.
My brother returned. Seems dying was the easy part.
A sword's poor company for a long road.
My honor left a long time ago.
No-one is promised tomorrow.
Follow the wind, but watch your back.
This blade never gets any lighter.
Virtue is no more than a luxury.
The road to ruin is shorter than you think.
Sleep is for the guiltless.
Justice. That's a pretty word.
Hmph. One step ahead of the past.
A wanderer isn't always lost.
Just looking for a road home.
Never could stay in one place.
I will follow this path until the end.
Honor is in the heart, not the name.
I will not forget who I am.
This story is not yet finished.
Is a leaf's only purpose to fall?
Hmph... dying's the easy part.
I thought azakana were nothing but children's tales. How wrong I was.
An unworthy blade meets a cursed mask.
Brother, what have you become?
Yone, I learned your lessons too late.
There is only death... mine, or yours!
If you've come to kill me... I hope you brought friends.
Killing people is a bad habit... but I can't seem to quit.
Which weighs more, Riven? Your blade, or your past?
Everyone faces a reckoning, Riven.
You can't run from yourself, Riven... I've tried.
Broken sword. Broken spirit.
Wuju? Hmph. Never heard of it.
Wuju? No, I wouldn't.
Nice... sword... boots?
Scurry back to your shadows, ninja.
Ninjas... I hate those guys.
Cute mask. Your, uh, mom sew that?
The blade above all things... except a good drink.
Who says I can't handle my drink?
There are three certainties in life: honor, death, and hangovers.
People keep running into my blade.
I'll give you the easy way out.
No cure for fools.
Kill me? You can try.
It's just death. Nothing serious.
Make it quick.
Don't start what I'll finish.
At peace with yourself? You will be.
Some things never dull.
Some mistakes you can't make twice.
I will not die dishonored.
No more running.
I alone decide my fate.
One blade, one purpose.
It is not yet time to die.
Ton!
Hasag!
Hasagi!
Aseryo!
Face the wind!
Choryon!
Son!
Sorye!
Igei ton!
Sorye ge ton!
It always ends in blood, brother.
Huh, three swift strikes...
Wait, that technique... huh.
Another wind blade?
Who taught you that?
I light the way to your darkness.
And so darkness, I become.
Some choose their path. Others are condemned to it.
There is no grey. Only light and dark.
Yesterday was a dream. Tomorrow is darkness.
The universe waits, and trembles.
Darkness is needed to see the Light for what it is.
Darkness above, despair beneath, around it, flame, within it, death.
And all that's best of dark and bright...
Darkness-
- gives form to the Light.
My thoughts are my own.
Darkness-
- gives form to the Light.
Get out of my head!
Angel. The time is upon us.
I am waiting.
The world waits for our blades to meet.
They will wait no longer.
From nothing, there will always come two.
I am here.
Order and chaos, aligned?
The universe is unbalanced.
Do not fear the darkness, fear the nothing after I am gone.
I am embers on the wind.
The truth slips through their grasp.
Battle is my destiny.
Harmony isn't the answer. It's the problem.
From the ashes rises a universe reborn.
Anarchy among you.
Harmony is a harsh mistress.
A firestorm is coming.
I am the wind of change.
This world is split.
Freedom is order, broken.
Only challenge can bring true change.
Order breeds ignorance.
The universe breaks everyone.
Cling to harmony, and you are robbed of freedom.
Disorder humbles all.
True strength comes from being torn apart.
Unity is another word for obedience.
I will break them all.
My blade, my choice.
Absolute judgement is the first transgression.
Harmony is a lie told to force obedience.
Only the broken are truly free.
I walk the path of disorder.
My fire does not fear the Light.
Follow, and lose yourself.
The Light does not save, it conquers.
I will burn this world to ash.
Order does not want allies, she seeks slaves.
The Light will fall. I will cut it down.
Discord sets the universe aflame.
To be alive is to know suffering.
This world needs to burn.
Chaos flows in all directions.
The Light cannot hold me. I will not be restrained.
The final twilight is at hand.
On any path that is mine.
I do not regret that which must be done.
Darkness is not condemnation. It is release.
Rebellion feeds the demon inside.
Laws bind lesser beings.
Anger, hate, love. It is all chaos.
I hunger for discord. My thirst for battle is unquenchable.
Darkness is coming.
In shadows they hide from darkness.
You hide your true self behind a mask of perfection.
Let us dance, angel.
You are... dangerous, but I am... more.
Can your wings bear you above your denial?
Without me, your existence is meaningless.
Our conflict is the crucible of reality.
Only a coward clings to tranquil dreams.
We are not meant for perfection, angel.
I will live. You will kneel.
No. You will break.
You and I are from a time before memory.
A memory is all you will be.
The Light cowers in shadow.
Chaos is unmoved by your tears.
Follow your path and it will break you.
Without your wings, think what might have been.
How should I greet thee?
With silence, and tears.
No more words. Let the blade decide.
Coming from you, I'll take that as a compliment.
What is order but a blade most dull?
Join the darkness. We have sugared confections.
Levity is overrated for a brooding soul.
Your ignorance does not amuse me.
Every blade, its own master.
Darkness falls with my blade.
Freedom is won.
Fight!
All rule is meant to be broken.
Night rends the dawn.
Your rules will be the first to break.
Your will falters.
Pain. Chaos. We live.
I will rip this world apart.
Chaos will remake you.
The Light fears me.
Revel in your selfish desire.
You were meant to be broken.
Fight your demons. Face me.
Come into the dark.
Peace is an illusion.
I hunt the Light.
Chaos will break you.
Order is deception. Chaos, truth.
Decide who you are!
Revolution? Inevitable.
Dependence is weakness.
This blade, my soul.
Chaos burns within us all.
Restraint suffocates the soul.
Summon your fury.
In all order, a secret disorder.
There is doubt within you.
I am your demon.
No regrets.
Unshackle your anger.
Discord ignites my soul.
An infernal edge.
Unsheathe fury.
Have you really come to talk with me? Again?
Strength is fighting alone.
My blade is no darker than your heart.
Another massacre in the name of peace.
Conflict is our only fate.
I am your abyss.
You cannot enslave darkness.
We are not made to follow orders.
You deny your darkness.
You are afraid of me? Good.
Seeking the Light is a selfish prayer.
No way out of chaos.
Fight! Let chaos consume you!
Discord burns away falsehood.
If you do not control me, I will end you.
Let go of your perfection.
You need the dark.
When will you give up, angel?
You mistake Light for truth.
Chaos does not bind, it frees.
You are blinded by your own light.
Your demons reside in the dark.
Truth offers no comfort in death.
Perfection is the cruelest lie.
It's not wings you offer, but shackles.
Chaos will clip your wings.
Admit it, my freedom terrifies you.
Anger builds!
Harness emotion!
The universe craves chaos!
The wind of change!
I am the storm!
I am thunder. I am lightning!
I will not be tamed!
Flash fire!
Sorye ge ton!
My rage is as deadly as my blade.
The damaged are the most dangerous.
From discord, we are reborn.
Your words echo into nothing.
Eternal night will cover this land forever.
Chaos conquers all.
Your weakness is my strength.
A certain darkness is necessary.
There is beauty in a broken world.
I am courage without conscience.
Order is a shepherd calling the lambs to slaughter.
Let go, and freedom will find you.
To be contained is torture.
I have set you free.
Day will fall to darkness.
Strength comes from being broken.
I have given you freedom.
You are released.
You chose a side. It failed you.
Order no longer binds you.
I own my shadow, and now yours.
I will never bend to the Light.
The crucible of chaos melts even an iron will.
Civility is overrated.
I will shatter her order.
The Light withers before me.
Fear is not real. Only an illusion of order.
The universe does not reward restraint.
To destroy is a primal promise.
I will not be contained.
There will be no dawn.
The darkness has overtaken you.
The best demons are the unpredictable ones.
So do the dark in soul expire.
Better to die on your feet.
Everything must come to an end.
You're welcome.
My demons are more powerful than yours.
The darkness within is stronger than the darkness without.
My demons are more powerful than yours.
The darkness within is stronger than the darkness without.
My demons are more powerful than yours.
The darkness within is stronger than the darkness without.
Your truth shatters so easily.
Conviction has betrayed you.
If you weren't made for destruction, why do you break so easily?
Know your enemy, know their blade.
Better broken than too perfect to live.
Those who live in shadow cannot dream of light.
So writhes the mind, remorse hath riven.
'tis time the heart should be unmoved.
Long, long shall I rue thee, too deeply to tell.
Pale grew thy cheek, and cold.
In the end, light always succumbs to darkness.
Fear the fire within the darkness.
Chaos has an unquenchable thirst.
All blades bend toward chaos.
Vigilance against the Light.
I am fury unbound!
Anarchy, chaos, destruction... this is life.
Mine is the sharp edge of night.
Darkness cannot be beaten.
Without chaos, the universe is nothing.
Chaos will rain like a firestorm of ash.
It is darkness that defines the dawn.
I will return this world to eternal night.
Chaos is the harbinger of greatness.
Turmoil gives way to opportunity.
The universe... life is born from conflict!
Only darkness remains.
Nothing lasts forever.
Rage destroys all in its path.
The only succour I require is solitude.
You cannot hide from me.
Order does not provide safety.
In the end, the choice will be mine.
They will all see darkness.
Soon, I will plunge all into darkness.
A vision of darkness is all I require.
There is no shame in choosing chaos.
Never regret that which must be done.
Order is an illusion, nothing more.
Order's hold is only temporary.
We will meet again.
This is not over.
What does not consume the fire, the fire will consume.
We only see what the Light wants us to see.
I know what I am.
This is not over.
She will pay!
