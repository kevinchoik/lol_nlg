To the arena!
The warrior's spirit is never broken.
My king commands.
It shall be done!
To triumph!
The warrior's spirit is never broken.
A Demacian does not retreat.
Victory calls.
Always forward.
Sound the march!
Only actions truly speak.
I may be outnumbered, but not even the odds can stand against me!
Find me an immovable object, and I'll put this question to rest!
Fate has made its choice.
Do not bore me.
Press the assault!
Perish with honor.
Their lives are forfeit.
Here's a tip, and a spear behind it!
True warriors are born on the battlefield!
My spirit remains unbroken!
